# Libra Ecosystem Proposals (LEPs)


# Contribution Process

This repo is to allow the Libra Ecosystem to enable participants to contribute allowing the Libra network to meet the needs of the ecosystem.

Unlike Core development Proposals, Ecosystem Proposals are intended to be a more
dynamic way of introducing standards and protocols utilized in the ecosystem that are built on top
of the Libra Network. It attempts to take a more lightweight process for approval, and much of
its process is inspired by the Stellar Foundation SEP process and [IETF][ietf].

## LEP Process
### Pre-LEP (Initial Discussion)

- Make sure to gather feedback and alternative ideas â€” it's useful before putting together a formal draft!
- Consider contacting experts in a particular area for feedback while you're hashing out the details.
