## Simple Summary

The `libra.toml` file is used to provide a common place where the Internet can find information about your organizationâ€™s libra integration. By setting the homedomain of your libra account to the domain that hosts your `libra.toml`, you can create a definitive link between this information and that account. Any website can publish libra network information, and the `libra.toml` is designed to be readable by both humans and machines.

If you are a validator, the `libra.toml` file allows you to declare your node(s) to other network participants, which improves discoverability, and contributes to the health and decentralization of the network as a whole. 

## Specification

Given the domain `DOMAIN`, the `libra.toml` will be searched for at the following location:

```
https://DOMAIN/.well-known/libra.toml
```

You must enable CORS on the `libra.toml` so people can access this file from other sites. The following HTTP header must be set for an HTTP response for `/.well-known/libra.toml` file request.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

It is also recommended to set a `text/plain` content type so that browsers render the contents, rather than prompting for a download.

```
content-type: text/plain
```

`libra.toml` is in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file format. The `libra.toml` fields and sections are described below. You should complete as much of this as you can. Many libra apps, including important wallets and exchanges, make decisions on which tokens to support based on the completeness of their Account Information and Documentation sections.

### Account Information

These are global fields in the `libra.toml` file.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
FEDERATION_SERVER | uses `https://` | The endpoint for clients to resolve libra addresses for users on your domain via [SEP-2](sep-0002.md) Federation Protocol
VERSION | string | The version of LEP-0010 your `libra.toml` adheres to.  This helps parsers know which fields to expect.

### Organizational Documentation

These fields go in the `libra.toml` `[DOCUMENTATION]` table.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
ORG_NAME | string | Legal name of your organization
ORG_DBA | string | (may not apply) [DBA](https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/doing-business-as-dba) of your organization
ORG_URL | uses `https://` | Your organization's official URL. Your `libra.toml` must be hosted on the same domain.
ORG_LOGO | url | Your organization's logo
ORG_DESCRIPTION | string | Short description of your organization
ORG_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS | string | Physical address for your organization
ORG_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_ATTESTATION | `https://` url | URL on the same domain as your `ORG_URL` that contains an image or pdf official document attesting to your physical address. It must list your `ORG_NAME` or `ORG_DBA` as the party at the address. Only documents from an official third party are acceptable. E.g. a utility bill, mail from a financial institution, or business license.
ORG_PHONE_NUMBER | string | Your organization's phone number in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164), e.g. `+14155552671`. See also [this guide](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223183008-Formatting-International-Phone-Numbers).
ORG_PHONE_NUMBER_ATTESTATION | `https://` url | URL on the same domain as your `ORG_URL` that contains an image or pdf of a phone bill showing both the phone number and your organization's name.
ORG_KEYBASE | string | A [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) account name for your organization. Should contain proof of ownership of any public online accounts you list here, including your organization's domain.
ORG_TWITTER | string | Your organization's Twitter account
ORG_GITHUB | string | Your organization's Github account
ORG_OFFICIAL_EMAIL | string | An email where clients can contact your organization. Must be hosted at your `ORG_URL` domain.
ORG_LICENSING_AUTHORITY | string | Name of the authority or agency that licensed your organization, if applicable
ORG_LICENSE_TYPE | string | Type of financial or other license your organization holds, if applicable
ORG_LICENSE_NUMBER | string | Official license number of your organization, if applicable

Issuers that list verified information including phone/address attestations and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) verifications will be prioritized by libra clients.

### Point of Contact Documentation

These fields go in the `libra.toml` `[[PRINCIPALS]]` list. It contains identifying information for the primary point of contact or principal(s) of the organization.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
name | string | Full legal name
email | string | Business email address for the principal
keybase | string | Personal Keybase account. Should include proof of ownership for other online accounts, as well as the organization's domain.
telegram | string | Personal Telegram account
twitter | string | Personal Twitter account
github | string | Personal Github account
id_photo_hash | string | SHA-256 hash of a photo of the principal's government-issued photo ID
verification_photo_hash | string | SHA-256 hash of a verification photo of principal. Should be well-lit and contain: principal holding ID card and signed, dated, hand-written message stating `I, $NAME, am a principal of $ORG_NAME, a libra token issuer with address $ISSUER_ADDRESS.`

`$NAME` is the principal's full legal name and `$ORG_NAME` is the name of the organization and must match the value in the `libra.toml` file..

The photo hashes allow principals to provide proof of identity to businesses and important clients. The photos can be sent privately, and the recipient can verify that the hashes match. Wallets and libra exchanges may request this information from an issuer and add an "ID verified" badge to the issuer's tokens in their interface.

The public key in the verification photo should be the issuing public key for the issuer's assets. If there are multiple, please include the multiple keys in the statement.

## Testing

1. Run a curl command in your terminal similar to the following (replace libraapis.com with the hosting location of your `libra.toml` file):

```sh
curl --head https://libraapis.com/.well-known/libra.toml
```

2. Verify the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present as shown below.

```sh
curl --head https://libraapis.com/.well-known/libra.toml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-length: 482
...
```

3. Also run the command on a page that should not have it and verify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing.
